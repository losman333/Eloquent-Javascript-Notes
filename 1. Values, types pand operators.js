/**
 * computers work with bits
 * 
 * bits are broken up into chunks(values)
 * 
 * every value has to be stored somewhere
 * 
 * values are determined by their type
 * 
 * numbers, text, functions
 * 
 * to create a value inovke the name
 * 
 * values have to be stored somewhere
 * 
 * bits are recycled as soon as a value is no longer needed
 * 
 * js uses 64 bit store a single valuel
 * 
 * number of different numbers can be limited
 * 
 * with N decimal digits you can represent 10N numbers
 * 
 * 64 binary digits can represent 264 different numbers
 * which is about 18 quintillion
 * 
 * computer memoery used to be smaller
 * people used 8 or 16 bits to represent numbers
 * 
 * it was easy to overflow small numbers'
 * 
 * modern devices use 64 bit chunks no need to worry about overflow
 * 
 * not all whole numbers less than 18 quintillion 
 * fit in a javascript numbers
 * 
 * bits can also be negative numbers one bit
 * indicates sign of the number
 * 
 * some bits store position of decimal point
 * 
 * maximum whole numbers that can be stored is
 * in the range of 9 quadrillion
 * 
 * large numbers use exponents
 * 
 * 
 * calculations with whole numbers called integers
 * are allways more precise
 * 
 *

// Strings 
/**
 * used to represent textn written 
 * 
 * how to indicate special meaning 
 *  use backslash \ n after backslash 
 * it is interpreted as a a newline
 * 
 * /t is a tab
 * 
 * strings have to be modeled as a series
 * of bits to be able to exist 
 * inside the computer
 * 
 * JS uses unicode
 * 
 * assigns a number to every character
 * a string can be described by a sequece
 * of numbers
 * 
 * javascript uses 16 bits per string element
 * describes up to 216 different characters
 * 
 * some characters 
 * 
 * can't divide multiply or subtract
 * add can be used to concatenatennn
 * 
 * what is a template literal
 * `half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
 * 
 * when you add back ticks ``to ${}
 * the result will be computed as a string
 * and included at that position
 *  "half of 100 is 50"
