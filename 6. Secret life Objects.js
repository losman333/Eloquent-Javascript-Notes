// Encapsulation

/** Core idea in JS is to divide programs
 * into smaller pieces
 * make each responsible for managing its not
 * 
 * knowledge about the piece of program
 * works can be kept local to that piece
 * 
 * when local details change only code
 * directly around needs to be updated
 * 
 * different pieces of program interact with 
 * each other through interfaces ( sets of functions
 * or bindings that provide useful functionality 
 * at more abstract level)
 * 
 * program pieces are modeled using objects
 * interface consists of a specific set of methods
 * and properties
 * 
 * Properties of that are part of interface are called public
 * code that should not be touched are called private
 * 
 * JS does not distinguish public and private props
 * and prevent outside code from accessing private ones
 * 
 * underscore used at start of property names indicate
 * those are private
 * 
 * Encapsulation seperates interface from implementation
