 * Server Part
 * 
 * CLient Part
 * 
 * server stores systems data
 * provides it to clent
 * 
 * serves files to implement
 * client-side sytem
 * 
 * provides it to the client
 * 
 * serves files that implement
 * CLIENT side system
 * 
 * servers stores list
 * 
 * client shows the list
 * 
 * list adds, deletes, and updates
 * 
 * updates happen immediateley
 * 
 * 
 * Application will be set up
 * to show a live view of current
 * proposed talks and their comments
 * 
 * no way for web server
 * to open a connection
 * to client
 * 
 *  no way to know which 
 * clients currently looking
 * at a website
 * 
 *  
 * no good way to know which clients
 * currently looking at a given website
 * 
 * long polling
 * 
 * notifies client something has changednn
 * 
 * arranges for client to open connection
 * server uses  LONG POLLING to send information
 * when needed
 * 
 * HTTP request allows simple flow of information
 * 
 * client sends request
 * server comes back with single response
 * 
 * websockets open connections
 * for data exchange
 * 
 * long polling
 * client asks server
 * for new info
 * uses HTTP requests
 * 
 * server stalls answer when 
 * nothing new to report
 * 
 * client receives information quickly 
 * after it becomes available 
 * as long client has polling request open
 * 
 * long polling usually set max time
 * for each request
 * 
 * servers responds 
 * 
 * client starts new request
 * 
 * restarting rquest
 * makes technique
 * more robust
 * allows client to recover 
    * from temp connection failures
 * 
 * 
 * Node makes it easy to manage many 
 * connection without creating
 * seperate thread of control

// HTTP interface
/**
 * HTTP interface 
 * used to communicate
 * use JSON as format of request
 * and response body
 * 
 * uses talk path
 * 
 * static files served
 * if paths do not starts with /tasks
 * 
 * Get request to /talks
